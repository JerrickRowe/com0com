The Null-modem emulator (com0com) is a kernel-mode virtual serial port driver for Windows. You can create an unlimited number of virtual COM port pairs and use any pair to connect one COM port based application to another. The HUB for communications (hub4com) allows to receive data and signals from one COM or TCP port, modify and send it to a number of other COM or TCP ports and vice versa.

## Features

    com0com: baud rate emulation
    com0com: pinouts customization
    com0com: noised line emulation
    com0com: paired port settings monitoring (baud rate, data bits, stop bits, parity)
    com0com: hiding 'unavailable' ports from user
    hup4com: spliting data from one serial device into several virtual serial ports
    hup4com: redirecting serial to TCP/IP and TCP/IP to serial
    hup4com: RFC2217 - Telnet Com Port Control Option (client and server)
